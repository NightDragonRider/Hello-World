# Hello-World
First Respo

My name is the Night Dragon Rider!
I shall not rest as long as there are men capable of thinking for themselves. I have been asleep for there have been no ICE DRAGONS before.
Now I possess my destiny in my hands. And I am coming, for when I am done you would be wishing for something as soothing as the WINTER.
